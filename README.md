# Todo app with Kotlin and Android Architecture Components

This is a simple to-do application. It uses [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) to store the to-do lists and items. It also uses [View Models](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html) to present the data to the Fragments. 

I used multiple examples to learn how to use these [Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html). Some of them were [Google Samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components) and [Dan Lew's counter app](https://github.com/dlew/android-architecture-counter-sample). Dan Lew's example was very useful to me. 

This was also my first app in Kotlin. I got super excited about it, when it was [announced as a first-class language at Google I/O 2017](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-announces-support-for-kotlin.html).

This app will be a continued learning experience for me. I plan to release on the Google Play Store. It will be my first ever app to be on the Play Store. Super excited about it.

If you want to run and develop on this app locally, just clone it and open it with [Android Studio Canary 3+](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html) (as of early June 2017) or Android Studio 3.0+ in the future.

Issues and PRs are welcome.

I still have yet to add few features, like:
* Notification reminders
* Being able to drag and reorder todo lists/items

I also need to write tests.
